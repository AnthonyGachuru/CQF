In this paper, I use the swaption volatilities to calibrate the LIBOR market model and generate the interest rate scenarios to price Bermudans swaption. The market risk of vanilla European swaption is analyzed and interest rate related Greeks are calculated using the scenarios. In the second part of the report, I calculate the CVA for a swap portfolio. The expected exposure profile, potential future exposure and other related statistics are also calculated and illustrated.
